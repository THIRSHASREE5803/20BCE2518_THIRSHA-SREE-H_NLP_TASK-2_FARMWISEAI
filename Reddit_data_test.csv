"360 Savings - How to close sub/second account?

"Series I Savings Bonds Redemption I bought $5000 in Series I Savings Bonds in March 2017 and treasurydirect shows that my interest rate is 2.22% with a ""Current Value"" of $5194.

If you redeem early, 3 months of interest is forfeited, but I'd like to sell and then re-buy since the interest rate difference (2.22% vs. 2.83% current) would make up the penalty in &lt; 1 year. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I went to redeem the bonds and quick math shows that monthly interest is around $9, so $9 x 22 months = $198, about in line with the interest shown.

"Backdoor ROTH conversion - account transfer question Hi all.  This is my second year of doing a backdoor ROTH.  The first year, because i had to create the dedicated ROTH account, I did everything with forms.

&amp;#x200B;

This year, the customer rep (this is TD Ameritrade if it matters) is telling me that because i only have the $6,000 \*in cash\* in the traditional, i can just do an online internal transfer from the traditional  to the ROTH.  They claim the form is only necessary when i'm converting actual shares.

It feels a bit concerning to not fill out a ROTH conversion form (in this case, it's a TDA995) - ie, having no paper record of the backdoor.

"$600+ refund from concert drama So here's the story:  


In Sept of 2018, I purchased two tickets to a concert for myself and my wife. Forward to November 2018, the card I used to purchase the tickets was somehow compromised. The CC number was used to purchase Uber rides in California and New York City within minutes of each other. I was refunded the money used and issued another CC number. Forward to mid-December, the concert was postponed, I wanted a refund because we weren't going to be able to make the new date. I contacted(AXS, the provider of the tickets) and they issue the refund with no issues, however the fund was issued to the wrong CC number. AXS will not refund funds to a different CC number(which I understand why) I have been in contact with my CC company(Credit one, never do business with him unless you have to) and made several calls to have the refund applied to the correct CC number. They have acknowledged they received the fund to the old CC number. As it stands, I'm waiting until Friday to have the refund applied. If it doesn't happen,

"Critique my Budget Hello, r/personalfinance. This is a throwaway account for anonymity sake. My wife and I started budgeted about 6 months ago and I'd like to get critiqued on potential areas we are overspending, general advice, etc. Here is some information about us:

&amp;#x200B;

I am the primary breadwinner and make $70k/year gross. On top of this I receive a bonus annually for \~10k. My wife is currently finishing her undergrad in history and works part time. She makes around $700/month after taxes. Below I will detail the current budget I have for us, savings totals, student loan debt (broken out w/ interest) and anything else I think needs to be mentioned. As far as bigger future expenses, we will be going to Disney World with my family this upcoming Summer and we would like to get a house in \~2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Current savings: $1,816

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly income: $3,461 (me) + $700 (wife), Total: $4,161.14

&amp;#x200B;

Current Budget/expenses:

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: $900

&amp;#x200B;

Loans (minimum payment - just mine): $441

&amp;#x200B;

Groceries: $325

&amp;#x200B;

Car Insurance: $126

&amp;#x200B;

Utilities: $275

&amp;#x200B;

Phone: $100

&amp;#x200B;

Internet: $67

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Subscriptions (hulu,netflix,spotify premium,kindle,etc): $73

&amp;#x200B;

Charitable Giving: $250

&amp;#x200B;

Pets (2 dogs and 1 cat): $100

&amp;#x200B;

Eating Out: $100

&amp;#x200B;

Beer: $25

&amp;#x200B;

Coffee: $25

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous: $100

&amp;#x200B;

Gas (wife commutes 35 min 1 way to school): $125

&amp;#x200B;

Fun Money: $100 ($50 for each of us)

Total Expenses: $3,237

&amp;#x200B;

Total left over to save: $924.14

&amp;#x200B;

This is a perfect scenario budget. Typically there are unbudgeted unexpected expenses that drive that $924 left over to more like $600/month. In the past these have been one of our cars needing serviced (we own both: 2007 Saturn Ion - 130k miles, 2008 Mercury Mountaineer 160k miles), unexpected vet bills, unexpected travel, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as loans go, I currently have $32,729.31 in Student Loans. Additionally, we have $9,000 more in loans that my wife has taken to finish her undergrad degree. This $9,000 was loaned from my parents, but I want to prioritize it because I hate owing my family money (even though it is interest free). Here is the breakdown of my current loans:

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 1: $2,886.11 balance. 3.15% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 2: 796.31 balance. 6.55% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 3: $4,188.08 balance. 6.55% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 4: $4,645.12 balance. 3.610% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 5: $1,852.20 balance. 3.610% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 6: $18,361.49 balance. 5.59% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My annual bonus will come in March and our plan is to use $5000 to pay off a loan (or put $5000 towards the $9000 I owe my parents), $3000 to pay for the Disney World trip, and the remaining $2000 to go $1500 into savings and $500 for a new mattress.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Feel free to ask me questions, critique the budget, point out areas we are overspending etc. I won't be offended, so be brutally honest need be. As far as a house goes, we want something around $150-$175k and 2+ acres. Our goal is to homestead.

Thanks!

"Can I create a traditional IRA as a backdoor Roth IRA if I already have a maxed out Roth IRA?

Edit: TIL a Backdoor IRA is a Traditional IRA converted to a Roth IRA (and taxed in the process if the money in the Traditional IRA is not yet taxed). It's a way to bypass the Roth IRA income limit.

"HSA Contribution vs Premium Reduction from Employer? My husband is receiving a small sum ($1,200) from his employer, to either be deposited into his HSA, or applied to the health insurance premiums that are withheld from his biweekly paycheck. Are there any differences in how this money would (or wouldn't be) taxed?

My understanding is that any contributions to his HSA would reduce taxable income, whether from us or from the employer. It is also my understanding that employer contributions to health insurance premiums are not taxable. So either way, is it correct that this $1,200 would not be taxed?

If we plan to max our HSAs anyway, having his employer contribute $1,200 reduces the amount we can contribute by $1,200, so that's $1,200 of our income that now will be taxed. However, on my husband's paycheck, his portion of health insurance premiums are taken out before tax. So if we have his employer contribute $1,200 to our health insurance premiums instead, there's still an additional $1,200 of our income that now will be taxed (in the form of additional take-home pay).

Both our health insurance premiums and any HSA contributions we have deducted from his paychecks are in the same ""Before-Tax"" section, so I assume they are treated the same in terms of FICA taxability as well.

If my understanding is correct, regardless of which choice we make, his employer is giving us $1,200 which is going to a non-taxable place, but since it will reduce how much we can put ourselves into those non-taxable places we will pay taxes on it in the end.

The problem is that she and I don't know a thing about financing car. She bought hers through a trusted individual long time ago, so this is going to be the first time.

I was told multiple times that the buyers should get a finance plan already written up by a credit union/bank before going to the car dealership because whenever dealers pull up your credit, it is going to be a hard pull which hurts the credit significantly. I get that part. 

Now, here is the question. When she buys a car and agrees on the payment plan scheduled by her bank, does the bank pays the price of the car to the dealer first, and then gets paid back by my mother based on the payment plan? Or is it that my mom pays directly to the dealer with that payment plan? 

I am sorry if I sound like a moron. I have so many things in my mind right now that this kind of thing does nothing but confused me even more. ",1,BlazinAzn38,2,LoveThyFood,3,BlazinAzn38,4,LoveThyFood,5,BlazinAzn38,6,LoveThyFood,7,BlazinAzn38,8,LoveThyFood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"EveryDollar budgeting app exists! I’m confused at the lack of mentions and love for EveryDollar on this sub. 

PROS:
- It has the same core principle as YNAB (assign every dollar to something), and the free version is perfectly fine.  YNAB is only free the first month and while I am happy that YNAB has worked for a lot of people, I just cannot justify spending on how to budget better when I can just put the time in and study. I see YNAB being more useful for couples and families though. 
- Good default categories. 
- Clean, intuitive UI. Good flow. Using the app isn’t a pain. 
- Being able to make future monthly budgets in advance. 


CONS
- You need to get the paid version to connect your bank, but I personally don’t need it. It is also my personal preference not to connect my banking info to my budgeting app. As a consequence, I have to input my spending manually, which I don’t mind since having to manually input it really grounds my spending and tells me where my money is going. 
- You can’t remove default categories. 


Am I missing something?

"How to get out from under a car loan? Last year I financed a 2015 Dodge Challenger (v6, SXT) at about $17,500. I've since moved to a new location where having a car may not even be necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The payoff amount quoted today at the dealship from my credit union is roughly $16,700.

&amp;#x200B;

I am paying $302/mo on the car payment, $75 for a parking space, and $300/mo in car insurance. I'd very much like to get rid of this car and just use public transport. This is in MD, inside the beltway, btw. I'm right near the red line, so I can easily ditch this car and be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that today, just as an experiment, I took it to a used car dealership to see what one might offer me for the car and they came back with $11,500. No way, Jose.

&amp;#x200B;

So it is very likely I am underwater on it - which is not a huge deal, because I am starting a new job on Monday that will easily allow me to pay down this loan until selling it is feasible - but because of the parking &amp; insurance, I feel like other options might be more prudent. I just don't know what those options might be. What are some good options for getting rid of this car? Maybe find a private buyer and take out a personal loan to cover the difference? That would mean opening another loan in my name, but it would also likely reduce my monthly payments significantly.

"Pursuing New Zealand Visa via Investment - Is It Possible? A few years back I went on a vacation to New Zealand and I completely fell in love with the country. I've decided that once I'm done working, I'd like to live there.

There's just one problem: Due to a recent change in the laws, it's impossible to own property in NZ without a residence visa, and it's really hard to get one of those.

The most obvious route is an employment visa, but my industry has little presence there so I'd rather keep my working life in the US for flexibility and upward mobility. Spousal visas are a thing, but holding out for a Kiwi wife is mostly a great way to never get married.

So I'm left with the monetarily-correlated visas. As an Engineer, I don't have the background necessary for an Entrepreneurial visa, so that leaves 3 options:

1. [Investor 2 Resident Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/investor-investor-2-resident-visa)
   1. Invest NZ$3mil (approx US$2.02mil) in NZ-based securities (no more than 25% in bonds) over 4 years, be under 65yo, spend \~5mo/year in-country during the 4 years. It's unclear to me whether the full 4-year period must occur before age 65.
   2. There's a requirement of having some amount of funds above and beyond the NZ$3mil for ""settlement expenses"". Assume NZ$1mil
   3. This visa uses a ""points"" system, and points are awarded for ""Recognized Business Experience"", including ""planning, organisation, control, senior change-management, direction-setting, and mentoring"" at a company with revenue over NZ$1mil/yr or with more than 5 employees.
      1. Something very substantial would have to change in my career path to get this.
      2. It's unclear whether it's possible to have enough points for this visa without this experience. There are several other qualifications (good character, good health, English proficiency)
   4. TL;DR US$2.85mil to expatriate before age 65
2. [Investor 1 Resident Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/investor-plus-investor-1-resident-visa)
   1. Invest NZ$10mil (approx US$6.75mil) in NZ-based securities (no more than 25% in bonds) over 3 years, spend 88 days in-country over the 3 year period.
   2. No age limit
   3. There's a requirement to have some amount of funds above and beyond the NZ$10mil for ""settlement expenses"". I'm pretty sure I've seen a listing that this visa requires NZ$1.5mil for settlement.
   4. TL;DR - US$7.75mil to expatriate
3. [Temporary Retirement Visitor Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/temporary-retirement-visitor-visa)
   1. Two-year renewable visa, unclear whether property purchase is allowed as it's a ""Visitor"" visa. However, after a renewal or two it's possible to apply for a [Permanent Resident Visa](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/permanent-resident-visa)
   2. Be 66 years old or older, and invest NZ$750k (approx US$506k) in NZ-based securities
   3. Have NZ$500k (approx US$337k) for ""maintenance funds"" as well as NZ$60k (approx US$41k) in income (including pensions, interest, securities sales, etc, so retirement funds earnings are fair)
   4. TL;DR - US$845k to expatriate after age 65, leaving enough US investments to bring US$41k/yr (US$1.025mil at 4% withdrawal, US$1.366mil at 3%)

I'm 28yo (37 years to 65), a Software Engineer, single, no kids, no debt, renter, $90k income in the DC suburbs. Currently have $67k in trad. 401(k), $17k in Roth IRA, $15k in high-yield cash savings. I hope to buy a house in 3-4 years (targeting $350k-400k price). Current monthly expenses are $2200. Maxing out 401(k) (match is 20% of contributions) and IRA contributions, saving cash at \~$500/biweekly.

**Is it reasonably possible to achieve any of these financial-visa options? What concrete steps could / should I take to pursue them?**

((Also, am I correct to be wary of expatriating all of my money? I feel like I'd be uncomfortable sending US$7.75mil overseas if I only had $7.75mil total, since NZ has a much smaller economy))

Obviously, the rules and available programs can and will change a lot in the next 37 years. But I'd rather have a plan than just hope.

"Merrill Edge / beginning investor Hi, I am new to investing so pardon my ignorance.  My small employer had a profit-sharing retirement account for all employees before starting a full-blown 401k retirement plan for us.  When the plan changed over, it required all employees to roll over the profit-sharing balance to some other type of retirement account.  Since I bank with Bank of America, I decided to roll the entire balance ($20k) into a traditional IRA with Merrill Edge.  A few months ago, I got a letter stating that I had to choose between a ""self-directed"" or ""guided investing"" IRA account.  Not knowing what to choose, I opted for the guided investment option and my money has been parked there for several months.  Based on my limited investing understanding, the ""guided investment"" option is a robo-investment account where they charge 0.45% annual fee.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not not primary retirement, just bonus money I want to park at Bank of America for its ""Preferred Rewards"" program (to achieve maximum credit card rewards, other banking perks).  My question is what is the best option if I just want to park my money at Merrill Edge?  With my current ""guided investment"" IRA, each year they ask me how aggressive I want to be (conservative, intermediate, aggressive) and Merrill Edge does everything for me.  I know based on the wikis that this subreddit recommends low-cost index funds.  Am I wasting money by paying a 0.45% annual fee for the ""guided investment"" account?  Should I opt for ""self-directed"" and then just purchase my own Vanguard funds to avoid extra fees?   I guess my misunderstanding is how overall fees in the investing world work.  I assume index funds have their own fees that are deducted anyway?  And then there's management-type fees like Merrill Edge's 0.45% fee ON TOP of that if I stay with ""guided investment""?  If I'm understanding that right, then there's no reason to stay with ""guided investing"" if I just want to be a passive investor and park my money at Merrill Edge?  Please help a newbie out.

"Planning for the real world. Hey guys! I am currently a graduate student going into my last semester of school. Reality is setting in and I realize I need to start planning a bit for life after school. I am currently living at home and lucky enough to be supported by my parents for the most part. I will be moving to a city sometime between July and October for my job.
My biggest concern is my student loans which will total $62,500. I want to pay them off ASAP. I should be able to get that down to around $15k before I move to the city between the majority of my savings and working. 
I have heard of services that refinance student loans at a lower rate like 2.5%. Most of mine are mid 4% to 6%. Are these services worth pursuing? 
I am also concerned about other costs I will be picking up when I move out like car insurance, health insurance, etc. I will be paying rent between $1,500 and $1,700 depending on what I am able to find when I am moving out. I will be making $70,000 starting out.
My girlfriend will also be moving to the city with me. Depending on what she is able to find for work we should have an additional $30-45k in yearly income. She also has similar amounts of student loans as me which I plan on beginning to help her with once mine are completely paid off. I have heard of income based plans she can utilize to manage her monthly payments a little more but I am concerned about the large amount of additional interest she will be paying over time. 
I want to start planning now and tackle this stuff as effectively as possible so we can start saving for a house one day and bigger things. All recommendations and advice is welcome! I will try to be as active in responding as possible today! Thanks

"Taxes: Hobby Income, No 1099's Issued Question about reporting Hobby income:

I make side money as a musician, so I go where the gigs take me. In 2018 I played at least some gigs that took W-9's from me, but didn't issue 1099's, since the checks were all below the must-send limit ($600?) and all came from different entities (the gigs were unrelated to each other). The total comes to about $1200 in additional income.

It's clearly a hobby, since I'm not formally trained, not taking a business-like approach to managing the process, and not using the money to support myself, and it only happens every few months. Frankly, I'd do it for free, but the convention in this set of circumstances is the band gets paid.

Reading the Schedule 1 instructions, Line 21 ""Other Income"" says something that confuse me about this: ""don't report on line 21 any nonemployee compensation shown on Form 20199-MISC (unless it isn't self-employment income, such as income from a hobby or a sporadic activity)"". Also, ""see the instructions on Form 1099-MISC to find out where to report that income"", and the line that ""Income from an activity not engaged in for profit. See Pub. 535"" should be included on line 21 (and Pub. 535 is about business expenses?).

I have no 1099-MISC's for 2018 to reference. How and where do I report this non-1099'd income?

"Getting ready to send a PFD with settlement offer close to what I owe. Should I offer less? So background is a bit important in this specific instance. SO and I have been saving up diligently each paycheck to get a lump sum large enough to offer settlement for a collection account In SO’s name from a couple years ago. This account had a co-signer, so it is also showing on this person’s credit report as well. This person is very unhappy about this, which is why we’re scrambling to get this money saved up and the debt paid.

The debt is a $7.8k debt (was $7k but CA has tacked on fees). To try to get this handled ASAP, we decided to go ahead and write a PFD and offer a lump sum of $6100 to settle and remove the account from the credit bureaus. We will be able to do this officially in a couple short weeks. 

Now here is the current situation: SO has a tooth that simply can’t be neglected any longer. Although he hasn’t gone and gotten a consultation, we believe after insurance he will probably be looking at a ~$500 bill, maybe as much as $1000. Again, not sure, but we’re highballing the estimate here to weigh the options, a”worst case scenario”, if you will.

I know people usually advise you offer 30-50% of the debt in regards to settling since CAs often buy debts for pennies on the dollar so they get a nice profit, but I’d like to pretty much guarantee getting this PFD approved, so we were prepared to offer that $6100, or about 78%. I wonder if it’d make much of a difference offering $5100 instead of $6100. It’d be very helpful to have a little money so SO can have this tooth taken care of.

Note: if it were up to us, we’d take our time until we saved the total and pay it off by summer, but this other person is getting difficult and angry, so we’d like to try to get this handled sooner than later.

Also, I know no matter how much we pay them, settlement or in full, they do *not* have to delete the collection account from the report at all, but that’s truly the end goal here, just getting our chances for deletion as high as possible. And I’m just hoping we’re approaching this properly. Should we stick to offering the $6100 instead of $5100? Am I offering too high to begin with? Any alternate advice is greatly appreciated.

"Looking for guidance. Hoping I am understanding correctly and making the correct decision. I want to start off by saying how thankful I am that I found this sub. I posted a question a couple days ago and the responses helped. I have been doing a lot of reading over the last few days.

I'll start of by saying we have made mistakes along the way but I am ready to face the facts and get serious about PF.

My wife and I are 35, with two children who are almost 4 &amp; 6. We just finished paying off all of our credit card debt. We took out way too many school loans along the way and are now paying the price. We have no savings or emergency fund but that will now change with no more credit card debt. I have just recently started contributing to my 401k (company match) at work. My wife is unable to contribute because she works per diem and therefore is not offered by the company.

We want to build an emergency fund, start saving for retirement (401k, IRAs), and to purchase a home (currently rent). We will be making a move back to our home state in about 16 months (I know we will need extra $ for this). 

Since the credit debt is now paid off, we have $1000-$1200 (working on raising this) a month that we can put towards retirement, emergency, loans. 

Breakdown of the loans (we were dumb). Monthly payments = $1,355

Wife: $99,841 @5.9% (refinanced)
Me: $7,681 @6.55%
      $3,116 @5.35%
      $10,409 @6.5%
      $3,955 @4.25%

      $8,017 @3.6%
      $4,132 @4.4%
      $6,395 @4.4%
Mine come out to $60,100 with an avg of 4.6%

Together we grossed $126,000 in 2018. This year will be the same if not a little more.

I said before that I have done a lot of reading on the this sub and want to make sure I go about this the correct way.

1. Should I take $500 a month and put towards emergency fund and the other $500 towards loans? After we have an emergency fund, put it all towards loans?

2. If I do this, I am worried I will never be able to save for retirement (IRAs). It would easily take over 10 years to pay all that off. 

3. Buying a house? Is this just silly to even consider?

After typing all of this out, I am scared. I feel so overwhelmed. I know I can't go back and change things and need to look forward but I just feel like we are in a deep hole and it doesn't look promising.

"What to do with extra income a month? Short story is we have plenty of debt and if we cleared that up we’d have about 2100 extra a month to help us save and pay for our 2020 wedding (this is already booked and we’ve already made payments towards it)

We currently have about $2k in EF 

I make a large amount of OT twice a year and my fiancé brings in commission every month that totals anywhere from $230 additional a month and up.

I’ve been throwing that money in savings to try to pad us in case of emergency or job loss. We have no where near how much we’d need for even one months expenses if needed.

We had almost 4K in savings but had to repay a loan from family and had to pay an additional 1.5k to a lawyer for an ongoing legal issue we are fighting so I tend to always want to keep padding EF in case we need to go back to it.

I have the snowball in place and we just paid off one card this month. My question is: do I stop throwing the extra income to savings and instead throw It at the debt or so I continue to save until I get to a months expenses?

We currently cannot save any money a month because that is going towards wedding savings (our venue takes a payment every 3 months doesn’t matter amount just total has to be paid by wedding) *I have an excel sheet I try to keep true to so we can pay this wedding off a few months before the wedding",1,Kevin827,1,Roarkyuubi1,2,MonroeMisfitx,3,Kevin827,4,MonroeMisfitx,5,Kevin827,6,MonroeMisfitx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also have $19,000 in student debt that I will be starting on after we get our credit card debt and our Auto loan paid off. The auto loan is ~$6,000. 

My big question is how do I start planning for my future and retirement? I would like to retire when I'm 60, sooner is fine, but I don't want to work my regular job past 60.

My retirement through the union is 22% of my straight time wages an hour gets placed into a mutual fund that is currently operated through Mass mutual. So it comes out to almost $7 an hour for every hour I work no matter if it's overtime or not gets placed into that Mass mutual account. I also get another retirement through our international office that's $35 a month per calendar year that I work. So if I work 30 years I will get $1050 a month when I retire. There's also a third one but it's really small, like $40 a month or so. 

What can I do to supplement my retirement? What do I need to be doing with my money until I retire so I can retire as early as possible so I can enjoy the leisure life with my family? I know practically nothing about saving for retirement.

"I am doing Financial Peace University and trying to get out of debt I am almost out of debt. My truck is the only thing I have left. I currently owe 12K on it but it is worth 18K. Right now it has 152000 miles on it but it is in perfect condition. The lease still has four years on it.

I basically have two options at this point if I want to get it done.

Keep it for those four years. at that point it will be paid off and probably have around 200,000 miles on it. I'm worried that at this point it will need to be replaced and I won't have any money saved up for a new one and I will just have to start with a new lease on a new car.

I'm thinking of selling it and using the 6K difference to buy a cheap car. Then save up cash AKA what I was already paying on the truck. $300. And by the time the cheap car wears out I should have enough to buy a decent car.

My question is which of these two options do you think is better and does anyone have a third option that might be even better?

"Existing car loan: Lemon Law settlement reached...must we continue to pay on loan? Good morning fellow finance gurus-

My wife has been embroiled in a lemon law case in California with her Fiat for the past year and a half. Long story short, a settlement has been reached outside of court (had not gone to trial yet) and we are awaiting the settlement amount to arrive as a check. The car is still on our private property and has not been taken back yet either.

Basically we have been paying the monthly payments since the case started, although the car has been inoperable this entire time (1.5yr) due to severe malfunctions. 

We have found ourselves in a rough financial patch the past few months while we have both been looking for new jobs and although we (well, I) technically *could* still pay on the car with savings, I do not want to. Our settlement had been reached and essentially doesn’t cover the last 4 months of payments, which I think is BS, while the attorney managed to eek out another 8k for his firm.

Although I want to push him to take it to trial to receive our fair amount, My wife just wants this over so she can close out this l=existing loan and get into a new car...which I understand as well. Benefit to settling early is that we dont have to keep paying the balance for 6+ months while we wait for trial.

Advice time: the lawyer said that he believes that if we STOP paying on the lemon car, we *should* be ok in the long run as the existing loan will switch over in the next 30-60 days. Any debt should be overlooked, even if it goes to a creditor notice. Essentially forgiven due to the circumstances.

Anyone heard of this before? I don’t want to stop paying and be faced with her having a huge red flag on her credit for non-payment, because she does need to get another loan for a new car soon.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you 😁👍",1,rapacityinblue,2,superheroninja,2,superheroninja,2,superheroninja,4,superheroninja,4,superheroninja,6,superheroninja,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Medical Bill Question, advice welcome First: I am not disputing the bill and there are about 5 items pending between my insurance and the provider, I’m really just trying to prep for the next step

So in short my doc ordered 3 MRIs, I call the imaging center and they say “we don’t do 3 in a day so you’ll have to schedule 1 separate”

Okay annoying but whatever.  So I get my bill in January for $1200, sucks but I got the MRI.  Now in February I’m hit with another bill for $1200. After making some calls it comes down to “you went back for more, they billed for the additional day”

So me following the imaging center policy forced me to be billed $1200.  Insurance is saying they covered their part, no dispute there.

The concern is I have to have this done every year, and it really feels like a kick in the crotch that their policy forces me to get double billed.

"Save for Home or pay off car? Hey Reddit! 

&amp;#x200B;

Provided I (27M) stick to my budget this month, I can get out of debt at the end of the month. I've just kinda lived of my CC for awhile to rack up flight miles but I'm kind of ready to be done with that monthly payment looming over me. So I'll pay it all off and be back to cash starting March 1st. I moved recently to Colorado and I traded my car in and got a good deal on a brand new AWD car for the mountains (safety first), though I've recently learned that buying new is not for someone my age most of the time. I make 92k pre-tax and have my 1k emergency fund and contribute the amount I should to get my match through my company for my 401k. I have extra money left at the end of the month (again, provided I stick to this budget) and my question is, is it better to pay off my car sooner or save for a home (through various methods like investing or not). I have about 18k left on my loan, my car payment is $310 a month with a 4.99% APR and I'm on a 72 month term without any penalty to finish early. I have about 650+ left over at the end of the month and I could use that to pay off the car sooner or I could invest that somehow and save for a home. What are my options here and which one would you opt for if you were in my position?

I quit Facebook, I hated seeing all the  people that felt entitled or showed off what they had. I'm feeling good on that end, it's been about a month now, whenever I get the urge I read books. 

Anyways, if I can quit Facebook, it's very addicting, I can totally save money, and only spend it on the budget and stuff everything left over in a close to reach savings...I just won't have the card with me, I'll put it away. I think I'm just always thinking about money and bills because I'm the only bread winner and I take care of all the bills, budgets, clothes and stuff. I do that because my wife she cares for my toddler twins, cares for the house and stuff, laundry and such, so I think I'm good on that. Anyways.

My dad is going to be needing a new car in the near future. He’s got over 200k on his Ford Taurus 2005 (idk how it still runs). Anyways, I have a pretty good credit score 754 FICO. I’m not exactly sure how much we would want to budget for the car I’d say max 8-9k. I’m with the idea of putting either a huge down payment maybe 2k or but a smaller and put the rest on payments to lower it. My question is what is the argument for and against financing a car.

"How fast can I expect to build credit? So as it stands I have bad credit. Last time I checked it was 592. I’m coming into some money here shortly and I have minimal credit card debt. I’m going to pay it off in full. That alone should raise my score a bit, cool. 

So in the past I’ve posted here regarding credit. I’ve gotten some very conflicting information regarding building credit in the past. I’ve been told to make late payments, I’ve been told to always keep a debt of at least 1/3 of my credit line, and I’ve been told to use it and immediately pay it off so I don’t accrue interest charges. I still don’t know what to believe, but I think I’m going to just use it to pump gas and get groceries, then put it off immediately. 

Anyhow, doing this, how quickly can I expect to build credit? How quickly can I expect to see my credit line increase (not that I need it or plan on maxing it out, I’m at $750 at the moment). At what point, scorewise, would my credit be consider okay/decent/good/great and on what kind of timeline can I expect to see these changes?

"Question about my car lease/ what to expect when it ends Hello all, I currently lease a 2016 civic, which is expiring in a few months. I leased it straight out of college, and while I have had no trouble making payments, I have a more financially optimal plan of buying a car in cash this time around.

"Retirement planning for parents First off - I'd like to state that this sub has helped my wife and I with our finances and now seeking help with parents finances which is quite different scenario than mine.  My parents are both immigrants. My dad had a very poor upbringing (farming in morning before walking miles to school type stories).  But our culture - we never talk about finances. They act as though its some sort of taboo subject.  Well Im trying to change that with them - as well as my children - and this sub has helped so much in my education on budegeting and finances. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the scenario - 

My dad is 69 now and still loves his job but working part time now (2 weeks a month) (8k/month post tax) receives 3k/month from SSI, and about 5k quarterly bonus. (11k/month + 20k for the year)

&amp;#x200B;

Currently has 1.7kk in 401k (all stock picks) - I've been trying to tell him he needs to fix his portfolio for less volatility but he's proud of his picks and still enjoys doing his research on that stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

They currently have around 50k in credit card debt ranging from 15-20% apr. (stubbornly wont pay it off month to month...)

&amp;#x200B;

Real Estate - they have poor credit and mortgage at 7% for all properties.

\#1) Current house they live in still has 500k Mortgagee. They pay 6k a month for mortgages on this house. Currently valued at 1kk

\#2) 300k owed, 2.2k/month, valued at 700k - sister currently resides there

\#3) 200k owed, 2.2k/month, valued at 400k - rental property

\#4) 100k owed, 1.5k/month, valued at 500k - rental property

\#5) they also have a 5th plot of land in california (5acres with no development just paying taxes on it)

\-property taxes on all roughly around 25k for all.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if people want the general gist of daily/monthly spending as well.  But it is a bit high. I think utilities for house is close to 700-900 a month. (brothers family lives with parents still and has 5 children - brother currently unemployed...basically my parents would be a lot more comfortable if they didn't have to take care of brothers family but it is a symbiotic relationship)

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of advice would you give my parents? or me - in this type of situation? In the future, I will probably be the one running the estate for them.

"How big of a deal are Roth Tax savings? Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently switched over to a permanent position at my job and was trying to plan my budget accordingly. Using a pretty accurate net income calculator I found out that my take home pay was going to be about $2800, and planned my budget accordingly. However, I forgot that my job also has an old school pension which takes out  6% of my salary (about $240 a month), so I've been looking to find ways to cut the fat and make up that $240. I've identified about $150 in places I can cut, but am a little stuck on the last $100 or so. My girlfriend is working for XP pts (law student) and we live in DC, so making $51k is a little tight (although doable) for two people. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to the important part of my question. My organization offers a dollar for dollar match on our 401k up to 10%.  I know I'd be an idiot not to take it, so I'm currently in for 10% on our roth 401k, but I'm considering moving it over to traditional. The way I calculate it, this would save me about $80 a month in taxes, which would get me very close to being back in the black (I anticipate taking like a dollar or so from each category to get the last $20).

&amp;#x200B;

However, since I'm fairly young and early in my career (24 at $51k) i'm kind of concerned about the tax losses down the line. So how big of a deal do you think these tax savings will be? I would obviously put roth back on as soon as I can (max 1 year from now), but this is really looking like an attractive option for me at the moment. Do you think it's stupid to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

I know an alternative option would be to find $125 (accounting for taxes) of side income from somewhere else, but I really don't want to rely on something variable like that. I'd much prefer to budget within my base salary and then use and side hustle money as savings, rather than rely on it for month to month expenses.",1,AutoModerator,1,HorizontalBob,1,The_Real_Scrotus,1,frugalmoney,2,the_bagel_warmonger,3,BradCOnReddit,3,The_Real_Scrotus,4,DeoVeritati,4,the_bagel_warmonger,4,the_bagel_warmonger,5,BradCOnReddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Note About Traditional Retirement Accounts in Pennsylvania Hello [r/pf](https://www.reddit.com/r/pf),

I was going through my PA state tax return for the year and I came across information that might be useful from a planning perspective if you're a Pennsylvania resident, a nonresident otherwise subject to Pennsylvania taxes, or a person who is planning on retiring in Pennsylvania.

1. Traditional 401(k) and IRA Contributions are **not deductible from income** for Pennsylvania State Tax in the year of contribution.
2. Distributions taken from such accounts prior to reaching age 59.5 **are taxable** to the extent that distributions exceed cumulative contributions (similar to Roth IRA rules for Federal Tax purposes). After that time, these amounts are not included in income.
3. Amounts rolled over from Traditional to Roth Accounts are **not included** in income for Pennsylvania Tax purposes.

In short, for Pennsylvania Tax Purposes, Traditional retirement accounts for Federal Tax purposes are treated nearly identically to Roth accounts. I can find no discernable differences.

This means that you could potentially pay zero state income tax on Traditional 401(k) and IRA amounts if you make those contributions *while living* *in a state* that allows for such deductions and subsequently move to Pennsylvania *for retirement*. Alternatively, if you make such contributions while you live in Pennsylvania and move to another state *for retirement*, you could potentially be taxed twice for such contributions. This isn't intended to insinuate that the 3.07% flat tax on income in Pennsylvania is enough, in isolation, to make decisions about saving/living in retirement; I'm merely positing it as something to consider for planning purposes.

Hope this was informative!

"Regarding dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts, I have a hypothetical question to clear my understanding. Hello!

I am trying to understand the concept of capital gains and dividends (or interest) in a taxable account (working with Vanguard).

Let's say I invest $90,000 in a taxable account in a mutual fund (VTSAX as a common example).

By the end of this year, it grows to $100,000. I would pay my income tax at my regular tax bracket on that $10,000.Then, let's say I invest nothing further. In 30 years if it grows to $400,000, I would then pay capital gains on the growth (at a different tax rate), on the the difference ($300,000).

I set up my Vanguard online account a few years ago.

I connected it to my bank account to verify myself back then.

I see I have a ""Federal Money Market (Settlement fund)"" in my Vanguard online account.


I want a traditional IRA (to my lower my adjusted gross income on federal taxes).  I think I want to buy a Targted Retirment Account, and I've got the year picked out.  I just want a traditional IRA (I think).

"Would being the beneficiary of a 529 I cannot use affect my financial aid for college? **tl;dr:**

* Currently 25 years old. I will resume college in a year to finish an undergrad degree.
* I'm the beneficiary of a 529, which was used to pay for my previous undergraduate education.
* I will not be using this 529's leftover funds for my next degree.
* I'm not the owner of this 529, so I can't shut it down nor remove myself as the beneficiary.
* The 529 owner is my father, from whom I need to hide my new education and degree.

**Questions:**

1. When pursuing financial aid, do I have to disclose this 529 if I cannot / will not use it?
2. Would being the beneficiary of a 529 negatively impact my financial aid options? 
3. Can I remove myself as a beneficiary of this 529 without the account owner's permission?

**Too Long But Reading Anyway:**

I already have an undergraduate degree, paid for entirely with the aforementioned 529, which left behind a few thousand dollars after I graduated. Original plan was for that leftover savings to go towards my graduate or professional degree.

Instead, I will return to undergrad to get a different degree. Because of Drama^(TM), I will not be informing the 529 owner - my father - about this, so I will not be using those leftover funds. I will pursue financial aid, and take out any student loans I can.

To my understanding, since I'm over 25, parental assets no longer figure into my financial aid - but I am the beneficiary of this asset, even though my father owns it. I do not want to accidentally commit fraud by omitting legally required financial information.

What are things I should be considering to make sure my investments are healthy and on the best path? Maybe checking my investment allocations?

EDIT FOLLOW UP QUESTION: I should have mentioned that the reason it felt weird not be actively putting money into savings accounts is because my bank account is growing, and I have more than is necessary in my bank account (more than I need for emergency fund).

"Calculating effective APR of Treasury Bills As mentioned frequently on this sub, 4-week T-Bills seem like a good way to gain interest on investments without tying your money up for a long time. Their current rate is around 2.4% or so. However, if you setup a T-bill to be reinvested upon maturity, your money will sit out of play for one week every four weeks, thus lowering your actual return by 20%. This is due to the security auction being held on a Thursday, issued the following Tuesday, and then maturing 4-weeks from then. Your money would then sit idle for a whole week until the new bill is issued the following Tuesday, if reinvesting. Your APR now went from 2.4 to 1.92%. Granted, your profits are not taxable for state and local taxes, but this 20% drop in productivity is easy to ignore.

"Questions on home buying process and preparing for it? Hey personal finance - I'm currently 22 year old male. This past year since I finished school I've been looking at getting my financial mistakes fixed, credit repaired, and getting myself ready for any emergencies and to buy a home hopefully in the next 5-6 years (currently my main goal for next step in life). I'm including my current financial situation and future ideas to see if there's any recommendations you guys have on that for me to get into a good spot while I still have time - by all means, feel free to jump to the end for the home buying based questions.

I currently don't know too much about the process itself or what would be needed, questions are at the end, but here are some details on my trajectory:

My Credit:

I'm currently sitting around 630 on the major bureaus, it was 675 last month before I paid my car loan off and closed that account.  I have 18k in student loans, payments begin in July at 200/mo but I've already paid 450 towards the premium. I had a delinquent account paid off in 2017 that I'm trying to have removed, if I can. I also have 1 late payment marked on there from my credit card from 2017 (I had a rough time with some stuff). Those are my two negatives. In the next 3 months I'll have my credit cards paid down to 50/3500 and 20/500. Ill have automatic payments for my car insurance (150) and my phone bill (120) going into them that I'll pay when the statement hits. I heard keeping a zero balance is bad, so I plan on keep the 50 and 20 as my balance on the respective cards. Neither card should jump above 30% usage. That will be the status quo on my credit cards from here on out. I can see my credit being at least low to mid 700's by the time I'm home shopping. I shouldn't have any negative marks by that time, either.

&amp;#x200B;

My funds:

As of right now I'm making about 34k/year managing a small business. I'm living relatively cheap, my monthly expenses being:  250 on rent, 150 personal loan payment to my grandfather, 150 car insurance, 120 phone bill, 50 in subscriptions (WoW, Netflix, Spotify, etc),  and 200 for student loans. I'm currently shoving a lot of money into credit cards to get them paid down, but after that I'll be putting nearly 500-600 into savings each month. By the end of the year I'll be close to 6k in savings. 

Now there are two possible ways next year can go... My boyfriend and I have floated the idea of me moving in with him come this fall/early winter. Where we live distance is rough in the winter time, so we may end up doing that to close the gap with each other. If this happens I won't be moving prior to finding a job, and the city he lives in has a lot more industry so I have no doubt I can find a similar paying job or a job in my degree field (EHS) that would be higher paying (40-50k bracket more than likely). This could lead to a potentially higher salary, but also I'd be paying half expenses which would be around 500-600 a month as opposed to my current 250. The alternative is if we don't decide to move or if things don't work (not likely, but entirely possible) in which my current aforementioned budget would remain in effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

The questions: 

\- First question is about the First Time Home Owner loan. I obviously haven't bought a home yet, so I should be eligible for that. Is it better or worse than searching for a loan through banks or financial services? How exactly does it work?

\- Piggybacking off that, I've been recommended to use a local Credit Union. Would that be better or worse than the first time buyer loan?

\- I've heard about PMI's before. I'm assuming that come time for me to begin looking for a home or buying a home that I won't have a 20% down payment. The housing market where I'm at is about 200k-300k for a decent mid-sized home. I do plan on having close to 20-25k to put into an escrow account prior to negotiating.

\- Are escrow accounts necessary? I've gotten an idea on how they work, but are they necessary? My BIL said he didn't want to deal with them and bypassed it, but I feel like the concept seems like a good guaranteed bargaining chip and a way to CYA when buying. 

\- A far fetched and very theoretical question - but one that could be necessary on circumstance. If things are to long term work out with my bf - or if not any other theoretical life partner - would we be able to co-apply for a loan as first time buyer even if he has used his first time buyer loan? I know that applying as married with a combined income would qualify but better homes. I hope to buy a home by 30 regardless of marital status, but this is just a question I've had since I know he's used his.

\- Are there any recommendations you guys have to what I've mentioned in my current finances and plans? I'd really like any feedback :)

"Which house: financially responsible choice or what you want? Here is another post of which house to choose and  I would like to gather some thoughts from the hivemind on how to decide on these things.

Some note, I'm single male in my 30 and my budget is 350k-400k in Austin TX. I am also extremely frugal (my current expense is about 1500 a month including rent) and minimalist (I own little to nothing and would love to live in a tiny house). In an ideal world, I would have an old but livable tiny house in the middle of Austin for less than 300k but atlas, those are bought up my cash buyer/investors. So here are my choices in front of me now. Below are the 2 options that exist for me, each has it's pro and con.

&amp;#x200B;

**House 1: Tiny House (620 sqft, 2b1b) on Tiny lot in heart of Austin.**

**Pro:** Excellent, and I mean, excellent location, in the heart of it all, fully updated to the max. I love the layout (feels bigger than it is because every sqft is efficient and raised ceiling) and it fits my dream of living in a tiny space (weird I know) and have a little piece of Austin. Small new space also means lower bills and less cleaning/maintenance/furniture. Small condo (3 units) but with actual lot of land. In some way, this is my dream home that fits what I want I need today.

**Cons:** it's fully updated (the frugal in me care little for luxury like this, in fact, it's a minus since it's upgrade to modern style and stripped all that is Austin). No parking (street parking). Very small lot (2700 sqft) and house (600 sqft) so the resale is bad as there is a limited buyers who wants to live in a such a small space and no way to really expand. One bed room, can't make as much money on rent as with a 3/2 below. However, airbnb potential is very high due to location.

**Summary:** I would love to live here in the middle of Austin but it is essentially paying for a very expensive place that will not appreciate as well as other properties. This is a frivolous expense for my wants. Expected payment of 2300/month, and if I rent out a room, it's 800/month for that room, maybe. Resale cannot be improved with updates or additions. Airbnb is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**House 2: Bigger house (1400 sqft, 3b2b), extra bed/bath but older further our, and perfect bones.**

**Pro:** good location (just 5-10 min driving out of this small city), not terrible but nothing is really walkable. 3 beds and 2 baths so decent long term rental opportunities (more money!). Family neighborhood (so many future buyers, more money!). The house has excellent bones like metal roof, updated HVAC, drains, good foundations and lots of room for easy updates (paint, cabinets, yard, etc) for awesome return (more money!!).

**Cons:** farther away, not by a huge margin. Higher bills / repair for older home. Drive everywhere. No cool walkable places currently (though the neighborhood has a lot of room for new things to come and can get into a car to anywhere within 10 min). And to be honest, the life of updating, furnishing, cleaning such a big space is just not what I need or want and very anti minimalist

**Summary:** Too big I don't need or want the space and especially the work that comes with maintaining, repairing, upgrading it. I also don't like the family neighborhood feels. I would rather live in the action as I'm single. But those two factors (family and size) is what makes this a financially responsible choice as it will cost 2300/month, rent out for probably 1200/month with two roommates, and with upgrades of 40k, I expect to sell for 450k-500k. So lots of money to be made.

For both properties, I expect to live in them for the next 5 years and take the next property when I get married.

There is not a losing proposition here and I feel very fortunate that I can every make this choice.

But what do you think is the most financially responsible choice? How should I contrast that with my personal preferences for tiny living in the middle of the action?

* My income and the emergency are related - I drive for Postmates, and I had car problems. I went three weeks without earning anything, maxed out my credit cards on fixing my car, and depleted the only savings I had on rent. I'm very fortunate to be living with my parents, so cost of living / rent are cheap for me, that's the only reason I got through.

* I got a [$2000 windfall](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b6biyb/can_someone_explain_the_sallie_mae_hate_to_me/) after that emergency , and since I might have a sudden lapse in income in the near future (my car isn't *completely* fixed and might die again), I need that back-up.

* Before that emergency, I'd been looking for a new credit card, mostly for gas rewards since I buy so much of it for Postmates/drive a lot, and if possible maybe a balance transfer to keep my Stupid^TM Debt from accruing interest.

"living with parent, debt free, would like some guidance. 28, I make 2k to 3k a month plus an insurance check of 1,500 coming for another year. No rent/mortgage, currently live with parent after one parent passed away 1 1/2 years ago. My sibling also lives in this house, so we have 3 incomes; I mention this because we are a close family and I think this reduces the need of an EF. My sibling and I both put up around 10k for a total of 20k to help pay off the house.

Trying to get my finances in order and plan for the future. Not sure how long I will stay here, but I definitely want to start saving to have the ability to put a down payment on a house in the next few years. Never had anyone teach me about money/retirement; so after some reading these last 2 weeks, I finally opened a ROTH IRA this week and put $5,500 in for 2018. Employer doesn't offer 401k matching so I'm not sure if I should still be doing anything with a 401k. 

I currently have 7k in my checking and savings combined. I opened up a new savings account with 2.25 APY and plan to put maybe 5k or 6k in there by the end of this month because I would like to put 500 in my ROTH IRA this month. I also have a child I would like to start saving for for college (although I am just starting out, I plan on taking online classes to pursue a career it IT, so maybe I can put this off until later). I also just got a secured credit card to increase my non existent credit history. My essential expenses are minimal with $100 for car insurance, $150 gas, $60 internet bill, $150 to help with groceries, $40 phone bill. Because of this and my close family, I think my 6 month EF of $5,000 might be sufficient, or am I missing something here or should be adding? 

Next is how much should I be saving my money for and what should I be putting it towards? I just started attempting to budget my money. 15% of my income for retirement is just enough to get 6k for 2019 for my ROTH IRA, I was also thinking about aggressively saving for this first for the next couple months to get the 6k in there asap to maximize the return on it. I budget $200-300 for restaurant and $200 for fun money which is probably overkill, but I have extra expenses left over and I'm just not sure what do do with it, and I'm pretty content with a lot of things I have. Only thing I can think of is maxing my Roth IRA asap and then just putting the rest of the money in with my EF, saving for a house in the future. My main goal as of now is to study IT and increase my income.

-is it better to have myself on the loan since I'm a first time buyer and can qualify for certain incentives? 
-also, my fiance' is currently in the process of selling a condo she owns. So until that sells, we only have about a 10% down payment. Once the condo sells, we are going to put the other 10% so we can avoid PMI. Is there any downside to that?

"Moving from a LCOL area to HCOL area. What are some good resources for budget recalculation or COL comparisons? I recently accepted a job in the Northeast after working and living in the South for my entire life. I've been blessed with the good fortune of living in cheap areas and having the ability to save pretty aggressively since college. My contract is up at the end of May, so I'd like to start planning.

Now, nearly everything I have heard and read indicates that, unsurprisingly, the cost of living in the Northeast is significantly higher than in the South. I have a budget that I stick to, but I know that I'm going to have to rework everything when I move. I will be getting a ~60% raise from my current salary, but I have no way of knowing the exact rate at which my specific expenses will increase.

"Should I transfer my HSA from Optum to Fidelity? My employer contributes $450 to my HSA at the end of Q1, Q2, and Q3, and I contribute an additional $50 each pay period. The HSA is administered through Optum Bank. Last year, after Fidelity started its free HSA, I opened one and put some extra cash in it ($300). My plan was to, after the end of Q1 when my employer contributed its first $450 for this year, roll all the money from the Optum account (~$1,550) into the Fidelity account and continue doing so every 365 days as allowed (if I do a trustee-to-trustee transfer, there is a fee). That’s because Optum had an investment threshold of, I think, $2,000. Any funds in excess of $2,000 could be invested, but all funds up to $2,000 would have to remain in the cash account (0.05% interest rate). Apparently though, my minimum investment threshold has now been lowered to $500.

My question is whether it makes sense to do as I originally planned and roll that $1,550 from the Optum account to my Fidelity account, or just invest the funds in excess of $500 with Optum. With the Optum account, I have access to VTSAX, VEIRX, VHGEX, VGHAX, VASGX, VSCGX, VSMGX, VIMAX, VGSLX, VFIAX, VSMAX, VUSXX, VWENX, some Schwab target date retirement funds, some PIMCO funds, TRBCX, and a few others. I would also incur a $2.50 per month “investment fee.” The Fidelity account has no fees, and I have access to anything I want. Currently, the money there is invested in 4 different Fidelity index funds (two of which have no fees).

I view the HSA currently as an investment vehicle. Thankfully, I am currently in good health, and I rarely seek healthcare other than flu shots and going to an urgent care clinic a couple times a year for routine/minor issues. I do not pay any premium for the plan, and no one else is covered by it (child is covered by wife’s employer’s insurance). I would continue with the HSA as investment vehicle and transfer all the funds in the Optum account to the Fidelity account every 365 days and then switch over to my employer’s PPO option if and when I start having health issues or my wife no longer has access to insurance for our child.

"Should I trade my mutual funds for an index fund? My parents/grandparents set me up with three mutual funds from wells fargo (PJIAX, CVGRX, BMCAX) when I was a kid and I have been blindly contributing and paying taxes on them since I was 18 (24 now). The expense ratios are 1.06, 1.29, 1.11 respectively, this seems high and the gains rarely beat VTSAX (for example). Currently the sum of the three funds is ~$20,500. It seems like the obvious answer is yes, I should trade, but I don't understand why they set up these funds in the first place if they're so expensive with just average returns.

"Someone hit and totaled my parked car so now I have options. I need advice and opinions. The preface:

I have two cars. One is a newer hybrid worth about 9k-10k that I still owe 5k on. I use this car to commute to work (about 30 miles each way) and love(d) it. Very little maintenance, great gas mileage, and it is a full size sedan so I can comfortably do longer road trips in it. My other car is a 16 year old German sports car worth about 4k on a good day. I drive it to work on Friday sometimes because its fun to drive but, because of its age, I would not like to drive it 60+ miles every day. It also only has 2 front seats. 


The situation:

Last week someone hit my hybrid while it was parked in front of my house and over the weekend I found out it is a total loss. Assuming I get it's actual value that leaves me with about 4-5k leftover after I pay off the note. 

The options:

My original plan was to keep the hybrid for a long time. I was going to sell my sports car to boost my down payment on a house I plan on buying later this year.

Option 1: Keep the insurance payout and daily drive my sports car. 

Biggest Pro - Don't have to buy a new car

Biggest Con - Will have to pay quite a bit on maintenance as the sports car is old and not reliable

Option 2: Buy a car that matches what I can get for my sports car (trade in or private sell) and what I get from the insurance payout. 

Biggest Pro - No more payments on a decently reliable car

Biggest Con - Limits potential car selection 

Option 3: Buy a newer car with a nice down payment from the insurance payout and what I can get from my sports car

Biggest Pro - More options when selecting a new car

Biggest Con - Will probably be making payments again

----------------
Other things to consider - I drive 60+ miles a day (almost all freeway miles with little traffic) to and from work so better gas mileage is a plus. Since I spend so much time in my car a nicer car is a decent boost to my overall happiness.

I have not been given the value of my hybrid yet so I'm still not 100% sure on the amount I will get back. If I get low-balled I will probably ask for help again on what I should do to try and get the actual value of the car. If there is anything I can do before hand, please feel free to let me know. 


I'm leaning towards option 2 right now but I'd like advice or opinions if I'm overlooking anything. I have money put away that I plan on using for a down payment on a house but I'd like to not use that without a plan to restock what I take out. For example I use the money I would get for my sports car before I actually sell it and then replace the money once I do sell it. If there is anything that is unclear ask away!

"Car-Buying Decision Inbound I'm a few months away from end of lease on my current commuter vehicle. I intend to replace it instead of buying it off lease.

I want this next car to be a 200k mile car, which could be up to 13-14 years if I buy new. That time frame bumps up against retirement so it will probably be the second-to-last car I buy. The time frame also means I need something I can be super happy with for a long time and that won't kill me in maintenance.

This is new territory for me. I've had exactly two vehicles for over 3 years. One is a Saturn Sky that's purely a pleasure vehicle and only exits the garage on beautiful days with my wife in the passenger seat with me.  The other is a 2013 Tahoe that's my wife's main vehicle.

My core requirements are:

* If it's new, it has to have the option for a non-leather interior
* It needs a reasonable shot at lasting 200k miles over 13+ years (~15k a year) without enormous maintenance costs
* It needs to be a 4-door, sedan or cross-over (no minivans or trucks)
* High fuel economy is a bonus

I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford any (reasonable) car that I want to buy, but I'm not in a huge hurry to hand a dealership or auto manufacturer a ton of money unnecessarily.

I've bounced back &amp; forth over a new Accord Sport, Civic Si, and even a Cadillac XT4. I briefly considered a Camry but, IMO, the Accord is the better vehicle. I've also considered 2-3 year old ""luxury"" vehicles that can easily be had for under $30k.

"Got on a wreck yesterday (not my fault), looking for some advice regarding responsibility of insurance and/or driver at fault. So I got in a wreck yesterday at a stop sign. Damndest thing, driver at fault thought I made a right turn when I hadn’t and hit me. I’m fine, she’s fine, her kids are fine. But my car is messed up. I had a minor fender bender 6 months ago (also not my fault) and the damage was purely cosmetic (replaced a panel and brake light) and it still cost about $2,100. 

The damage is pretty extensive this time around. I’m not looking for an estimate or anything like that, though I’d be happy to share pictures. I was able to drive it home (all highway, so straight) but making sharp turns causes the tires to rub against the damage. I’m worried there’s damage to the frame which would total it. 

In the meantime, the insurance company (of the at fault driver) is providing me with a rental which I’m going to pick up in a few hours. A damage appraiser is going to call soon to schedule a time to view the damage. I’m sort of concerned that the insurance company is going to screw me.

"How much house can we afford? Need your opinions - NYC area I know everyone has a different rule of thumb, and people's circumstances are all unique, etc.  But would love your best guess on what is a good amount for a home for us.

Ages:  Me 36 and him 38.  We potentially would like do a 15-year fixed mortgage but would also take a 30-year with wiggle room to pay off early as we don't want to be 65 years old with a mortgage payment.  We both work in NYC (me Manhattan, him varies but in the boroughs)

Income (both W-2):

**Me:  $132k base**  **Him:  $90k base** but guaranteed overtime and approximately takes in **$145k.**  Side jobs an extra $2000-5000 per year.  He will be getting a raise to $110k but less overtime in December.  Likely $120-130k gross to be safe when we purchase.  So a combined **$260k.**

Taxes are NY state taxes - no city taxes.  Home taxes are generally cheaper in the bounds of NYC but the houses are more expensive here.  We could also commute by rail (cheaper house, higher taxes up to $15k), but it would increase our transit expenses (which are mostly pre-tax at least).  We DO plan to have kids and work so DAY CARE will be an expense.

**Retirement savings combined:** $600k

We both max out our 401k's and he has the option to do an additional $19k per year which he usually does so that is **$57k off** the top of our gross.  We also both do pre-tax transit and FSA so that is another **$840 a month off the gross** but we spend it on transit expenses listed below.

**Down payment savings:**  $250k - We have another year to save but starting to look at neighborhoods.

**Other Savings:**  $80k

***Combined*** ***Monthly average expenses currently aside from housing/utilities***

**Car Insurance:**  $250

**Transit Other:**  $400-700 per month (gas, trains, subway, parking)

**Food:**  $600-1000 (eat out a lot, hard habit to break since we work a lot)

**Cell phones:**  $90

**Cable/Netflix/Sports packages:**  $180

**Clothing:**  $120-300

**Gym:**  $300-450

**Student Loan (only one remains!):**  $67

**Health/Co-pays:**  $40

**Toiletries/household stuff:**  $50

**Vacations/ski trips (at least a couple per year):** $250-500 /m

**Miscellaneous entertainment/concerts/happy hours etc:**  $500

1. Thus far they have not been able to provide details on past performance of companies in their portfolio (something akin to a prospectus would be ideal), so all we have is ""curated optimism"".
2. Obviously there is no diversification, since it's all in my company.
3. There is no liquidity (average holding is about 4 years, but that's no guarantee).
